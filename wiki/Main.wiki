#summary Start here.

Welcome to the *as3-universal-analytics* project.

TODO


== Minimum Requirement ==

This library require *Flash Player 11.0*  or *AIR 3.0* (both released on 04/10/2011).

It is possible to backport the library for earlier versions (FP 10.0 and AIR 2.0),<br>
you will need to provide your own implementation of<br>
`com.google.analytics.utils.generateUUID()`.

== Legacy ==

If you absolutely need support for *Flash Player 9.0*<br>
you can use the library [https://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/ gaforflash], which is now considered legacy (old!).


== Non Goals ==

There is no plan to support a !JavaScript Bridge with `analytics.js`.

It is out of question to port the library to !ActionScript 2.0 (feel free to do it yourself).


== Misc ==
